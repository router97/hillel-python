I live on the Muharraq Gardens building on Budaiya highway. 
My name is Batriq Iban Ba-Atman. 
I'm 27 years old. 
I believe in adhering to the core pillars of Islam. 
In the morning, before suhur, I do the Fajr prayer whilst prostrating myself in the air. 
I can do a thousand now. 
In the shower, I perform ghusl to be clean for the next prayer. 
This is because I've broken my fast with masturbation. During wudu, I apply a 300SPF sun lotion, to protect from the dessert sun. 
Afterwards, I always use a South Asian oud with little or no alcohol. Because alcohol is haram. 
There is an idea of Batriq Iban Ba-Atman, some kinda of abstraction, but there is no real me. 
Only an entity.
